        <h2>Welcome to My Personal Philosophy Blog</h2>
       <p>Welcome, dear reader. You have graciously donated your time in reading these words here, and I will hope to repay you with interesting ideas delivered interestingly. Above you have, in my view, the six main perspectives to view society, which will hopefully yield you ideas on how to improve your own situation. I recommend economics. Explore. Have fun!</p>

<p>I used Chat-GPT 4.0 to code this website, but not to write it. I recommend that if you haven't used this AI model for coding or data analysis, that you try it out and build your own project like this, it was super fun and empowering. The conversational writing style of this blog is intentional to prove to you that I am not an AI.</p>

<p>Why these 6 perspectives to view the world from? Well, in my opinion these are the main driving forces of the world around us and all are important for understanding what the world is and how we can view things differently. There are economic, historical, technological, political, religious and cultural forces which drive behavior in the world and are all importantly interlinked with one another.</p>

<p>I will try to intersperse all the interesting ideas that I have stolen from people into their respective categories, and also some juicy smaller personal details on how you might be able to improve your own life.</p>
