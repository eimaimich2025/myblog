    <h2>Economics</h2>
    <p> You have a bunch of homo-sapiens running around this blue floating rock in space. For evolutionary purposes, they are constantly striving to improve the conditions of their families, communities, and their own lives, through the consumption of goods and services. Thus, they will always be wanting. Houses, haircuts, automobiles, iPhones, burgers, and all the luxuries of modern life will not be enough. Still, I believe this wanting to be in good spirit.</p>
    <p>Given our unlimited wants, we need to satisfy them with goods and services. Now things get interesting because we have limited resources. Sacrifices must be made. Even if robots were to build everything for us, there would still be fundamental constraints on the number of physical resources and the energy we can extract from our sun. There is also a limitation to the fungibility of goods. Only one Mona Lisa can exist, even though many people might want it. Therefore, unlimited wants can never be satisfied. We’ve arrived at the unsolvable problem of economics.</p> 
    <div class="subtitle"> From the Start </div>
    <p>Adam Smith: At the start of the 1700s, something extraordinary was happening in the world. Until then, nearly all of human labor was expended on agriculture and most people would make their own clothes, houses, and baskets. Nearly everyone was a generalist, and did things by hand. But then, with the invention of the steam engine (1712), in concordance with other inventions like the seed drill (1701) we began to need less and less human labor for every grain of wheat. Instead of using human and animal muscles to move around crops on farms or to manipulate the shape of materials into objects such as hats or wagons, we began to use mechanical muscles through the steam engine and the discovery of fossil fuels. We could specialize more. Factories started to pop up in England and Scotland.</p>
    <p>At the time, mercantilism was the prevailing economic theory. In essence, this idea regarded value as being derived from the land. That is because you plant seeds in the ground and things of value (crops) grow out of that land to create value, or you dig value from the earth (gold). Indeed, if you were to construct a wooden carriage, you would not be creating value but simply rearranging the material which grew from trees and already had value.</p>
    <p>What is so pernicious about this idea is that it views the total value of the world as fixed. It would be fixed to the amount of farmland or the number of mines you could control. Your neighbor’s good is to your detriment; the world is zero-sum. Thus, the only way to increase the amount of value you had was to invade or steal from your neighbor. Mercantilism caused nations to invade one another. It fueled the colonialist fervor; It led to Francisco de Toledo, invading the incas to control the Potosí silver mine instead of trading with them. It was a time of Europe conquering the world with mercantilism while simultaneously most people were agrarian, and small workshops and factories started to dot the European continent.</p>
    <p>Enter the scene in 1723, with the birth of Adam Smith in Kirkcaldy, Scotland. As a young man he witnessed these rapid changes first hand. He became a professor of Moral Philosophy and logic at the university of Glasgow, but then in 1776, at the beginning of the American Revolution, he published “The Wealth Of Nations”, which created the entire field of economics. There were so many brilliant points mentioned in the work however the most important was the refinement of the theory of the division of labor. He uses the example of a pin factory to examine how people become more productive as the specificity of their task gets narrower. A single person could not manage to mine, smelt, cast, pour, draw (Pulling the metal through a die to create wire of the desired diameter) , straighten, cut, sharpen, head, polish, and finally place the pin in packaging for purchase. It would be near impossible to even make a single pin in a day. However, in a factory with one person specializing in each function, they could produce hundreds of pins a day, an output far greater than the sum of if each individual worker produced only pins. It might seem obvious to us now, given how hyper-specialized our economy is, but at the time this was revolutionary.</p>
    <p>But he had more to add on. He added the invisible hand. This is the idea that, from many individuals pursuing their rational self-interest, larger beneficial patterns emerge. For example, a baker makes bread so that she may sell it for a profit to support herself and her family. If there are thousands of bakers just like her, the collective result of each baker pursuing her self interest is better, cheaper bread for everyone.</p>
    <p>Smithian or Marxist economists would assert that value is created when labor is expended towards the production of a good or service. Under this labor theory of value framework, the process of building a car is productive because labor and capital was expended towards the assembly of said vehicle. It asserts that, because workers are hired, wages are paid and machinery is utilized, that the cost of the inputs is translated into the value of the car, and thus economic value is generated from labor. If a Rolls Royce takes ten times as much labor and capital to produce than a Honda, then its value should be ten times more. </p>
    <p>Similarly, producing F-35 jet fighters creates value because of the people working on it. Boeing or Lockhead Martin produces economic value through the employment of workers and the utilization of machine capital. Proponents of this idea believe that this employment stimulates the economy because the wages contribute to aggregate demand which contributes to consumption which contributes to overall GDP growth. We would be fully utilizing our factories, our workforce and production capacity, and in addition to all this, contributing to GDP growth; why on earth would this not be creating value?</p>
    <p>It is because this labor theory of value framework does not reflect the real value of the good, which really is in the subjective utility experienced by the end consumer of that good. Suppose the car or the F-35 Jet both broke down, under Smithian or Marxist economics, they would still have value because of their process of production. Here lies the small flaw in the way that these two great economists thought about value and still how many people think about value. F-35s only create value to the extent that they increase the collective utility experienced by people in the national defense produced by the Jets. In addition, the GDP growth is real. However the same would be true for any stimulatory spending regardless of what object need be produced if any at all. </p>

    <p> If we were to choose to be born in anytime throughout history, it would be undoubtably wise to choose today. As seen in the chart above, the rates of global poverty are at historic lows, indeed by nearly all metrics our society is outperforming past generations. While I will acknowledge there are challenges that we face today, those challenges pale in comparison to those faced by our ancestors. </p>
