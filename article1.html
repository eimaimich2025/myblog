    <h2>Economics</h2>
    <p> You have a bunch of homo-sapiens running around this blue floating rock in space. For evolutionary purposes, they are constantly striving to improve the conditions of their families, communities, and their own lives, through the consumption of goods and services. Thus, they will always be wanting. Houses, haircuts, automobiles, iPhones, burgers, and all the luxuries of modern life will not be enough. Still, I believe this wanting to be in good spirit.</p>
    <p>Given our unlimited wants, we need to satisfy them with goods and services. Now things get interesting because we have limited resources. Sacrifices must be made. Even if robots were to build everything for us, there would still be fundamental constraints on the number of physical resources and the energy we can extract from our sun. There is also a limitation to the fungibility of goods. Only one Mona Lisa can exist, even though many people might want it. Therefore, unlimited wants can never be satisfied. We’ve arrived at the unsolvable problem of economics.</p>
