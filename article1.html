    <h2>Economics</h2>
    <p> You have a bunch of homo-sapiens running around this blue floating rock in space. For evolutionary purposes, they are constantly striving to improve the conditions of their families, communities, and their own lives, through the consumption of goods and services. Thus, they will always be wanting. Houses, haircuts, automobiles, iPhones, burgers, and all the luxuries of modern life will not be enough. Still, I believe this wanting to be in good spirit.</p>
    <p>Given our unlimited wants, we need to satisfy them with goods and services. Now things get interesting because we have limited resources. Sacrifices must be made. Even if robots were to build everything for us, there would still be fundamental constraints on the number of physical resources and the energy we can extract from our sun. There is also a limitation to the fungibility of goods. Only one Mona Lisa can exist, even though many people might want it. Therefore, unlimited wants can never be satisfied. We’ve arrived at the unsolvable problem of economics.</p> 
    <div class="subtitle"> From the Start </div>
    <p>Smithian or Marxist economists would assert that value is created when labor is expended towards the production of a good or service. Under this labor theory of value framework, the process of building a car is productive because labor and capital was expended towards the assembly of said vehicle. It asserts that, because workers are hired, wages are paid and machinery is utilized, that the cost of the inputs is translated into the value of the car, and thus economic value is generated from labor. If a Rolls Royce takes ten times as much labor and capital to produce than a Honda, then its value should be ten times more. </p>
    <p>Similarly, producing F-35 jet fighters creates value because of the people working on it. Boeing or Lockhead Martin produces economic value through the employment of workers and the utilization of machine capital. Proponents of this idea believe that this employment stimulates the economy because the wages contribute to aggregate demand which contributes to consumption which contributes to overall GDP growth. We would be fully utilizing our factories, our workforce and production capacity, and in addition to all this, contributing to GDP growth; why on earth would this not be creating value?</p>
    <p>It is because this labor theory of value framework does not reflect the real value of the good, which really is in the subjective utility experienced by the end consumer of that good. Suppose the car or the F-35 Jet both broke down, under Smithian or Marxist economics, they would still have value because of their process of production. Here lies the small flaw in the way that these two great economists thought about value and still how many people think about value. F-35s only create value to the extent that they increase the collective utility experienced by people in the national defense produced by the Jets. In addition, the GDP growth is real. However the same would be true for any stimulatory spending regardless of what object need be produced if any at all. </p>

    <p> If we were to choose to be born in anytime throughout history, it would be undoubtibly wise to choose today. As seen in the chart above, the rates of global poverty are at historic lows, indeed by nearly all metrics our society is outperforming past generations. While I will acknowledge there are challenges that we face today, those challenges pale in comparison to those faced by our ancestors. </p>
